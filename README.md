OTE-Stack is an edge computing platform for 5G and AI. By virtualization the bottom layer can shield heterogeneous characteristics and give a unified access of cloud edge, mobile edge and private edge. The upper layer provides low-latency, high-reliability and cost-optimal computing support at the edge through the cluster management and intelligent scheduling of multi-tier clusters. And at the same time OTE-Stack makes device-edge-cloud collaborative computing possible.
